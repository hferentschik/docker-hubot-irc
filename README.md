## Usage

<a name="minishift-stand-ups"></a>
### Minishift stand-ups

Minibot drives the daily stand-ups of the Minishift team on #minishift on irc.freenode.net.
For this it utilizes the [hubot-standup](https://github.com/miyagawa/hubot-standup) plugin.

In order to add and remove users to the stand-up [hubot-auth](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-auth) is used.

To add a user to the stand-ups:

    minibot <user> has a minishift member role

To remove a user from the stand-ups:

    minibot <user> doesnâ€™t have a minishift member role

To list the roles of a user:

    minibot what roles does <user> have

<a name="sprint-backlog"></a>
### Sprint backlog

Sprint backlogs in comma separated format can be added to Minibot brain via a webhook:

    curl -X POST http://<IP>:9009/hubot/sprint -d sprint=134 -d data="$(cat sprint-134.csv)"

Once uploaded the backlog can be printed via the Minibot command:

    minibot print sprint <id>

 An issue can be marked as completed by:

    minibot mark issue <issue-id> of sprint <sprint-id> completed

 To see which sprints Minibot knows about:

    minibot list known sprints

<a name="ci-notifications"></a>
### CI notifications

At the moment [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/minishift/minishift), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com) and [Circle CI](https://circleci.com) send notifications to Minibot.
The required webhooks are configured in [.travis.yml](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/.travis.yml), [appveyor.yml](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/appveyor.yml) resp. [circle.yml](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/circle.yml) in the Minishift [repository](https://github.com/minishift/minishift).

### Running the Minibot image

    $ make run

<a name="testing-webhooks"></a>
### Testing webhooks

The [testdata](https://github.com/minishift/minibot/tree/master/testdata) directory contains some sample JSON payload files to test the Minibot webhook integration.
To test a webhook, execute the following against your local instance of Minibot:

    $ cd testdata
    $ curl http://<IP>:9009/hubot/travis-ci --data-urlencode payload@travis-ci.json
    # or
    $ curl http://<IP>:9009/hubot/circleci -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @circleci.json
    # or
    $ curl http://<IP>:9009/hubot/appveyor -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @appveyor.json

where:

* \<IP\> is the IP of your Docker daemon

To test the CentOS CI release webhook, execute:

    $ curl http://<IP>:9009/hubot/centosci -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"payload":{"status":"success","message":"Minishift v1.0.0 successfully released by https://ci.centos.org/job/minishift-release/100","url":"https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases/tag/v1.0.0"}}'
